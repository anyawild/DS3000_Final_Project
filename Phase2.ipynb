    "In the last few years, wildfires have starting popping up in Europe in several countries, and has ravaged many homes and land. The fires post an economic, health, and safety threat to families and individuals, and are likely an indicator of increasing global temperatures and underlying climate change.\n",

    "[NASA Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS)](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/find-data/near-real-time/firms/viirs-i-band-375-m-active-fire-data) uses Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) 375 m imaging to capture fires as they happen worldwide, and publishes the data for public access with the use of an API key. Although there are other sensors that NASA uses concurrently, we dicded the VIIRS software is the most accurate and up-to-date, and would servce us best for this project. \n",

    "### Possible ML uses:\n",
    "For exploring the questions above, there are a couple of different ML concepts that may be applicable. For understanding wildfire 'hotspots', K-means clustering could possibly be used to help identify patterns in the data points. Time series analysis could be used for understanding and predicting the seasonality of wildfires. Regression could also be used to understand if geographical location / territory affects fire intensity (brightness) and whether that could be used to predict fire intensity. "
